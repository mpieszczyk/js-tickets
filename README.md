A special "system" for case/problem management, which was created at the request of a friend.

After completing the form, the system connects to the MongoDB database API created on mlab.com and adds data to the JSON object, then automatically retrieves all data and displays it in the table.
At this moment the table has options to select the number of displayed lines with pagination and it is sortable.

Soon I would like to add to it the possibility of editing/deleting data and phrase search engine.

The entire code was written in JS, exactly jQuery with AJAX, HTML5 and BOOTSTRAP framework.
