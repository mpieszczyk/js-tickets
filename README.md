# js-tickets
<code>https://mpieszczyk.github.io/js-tickets/</code>

A special "system" for tickets management, which was created to learn JS.

Currently app has no DB connected - need to find other solution, because mlab isn't longer available.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After completing the form, the system connects to the MongoDB database API created on mlab.com and adds data to the JSON object, then automatically retrieves all data and displays it in the table.

At this moment the table has features like:

<ul>
<li>options to select the number of displayed lines with pagination,</li>
<li>it is sortable,</li>
<li>it has phrase search engine,</li>
<li>data can be edited or deleted.</li>
</ul>

The entire code was written in JS, exactly jQuery with AJAX, HTML5 and BOOTSTRAP framework.
